# Traffic-Congestion-Prediction
Traffic Congestion Prediction using Random Forest Regressor. > A machine learning solution that analyzes historical traffic data to predict congestion levels. Features data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a trained ensemble model for real-time traffic forecasting.


# 🚦 Traffic Congestion Prediction
**Capstone Project - 

## 📝 Overview
This project aims to predict urban traffic density using machine learning. By analyzing variables like time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions, the model forecasts congestion levels to help in better urban planning and route optimization.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Utilized the given dataset by my tutor
2. **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (Day, Weather), and scaled features.
3. **Model Selection:** Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and prevent overfitting.
4. **Evaluation:** Measured performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared scores.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Model:** Random Forest (Ensemble Learning)

## 📈 Key Results
* **Accuracy/R² Score:** 85%
